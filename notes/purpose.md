What is the purpose of creating a transformer-based architecture for No Limit Texas Hold'em?

Transformer generalise information really well, so they'll be able to diverege to nash strategies very quickly. Also by using a clever trick, we can swap out card tokens for 'ambigous' tokens. Eg instead of using tokens RANK_A SUIT_H you use RANK_X SUIT_X for a mystery card. Then by injecting these mystery tokens randomly to hide information from the models (not just cards but bets etc), they will not only generalise information better (at the cost of a bit of volatility), but they will also reveal hidden information and general tactics. Instead of looking at aggregate reports, the user can use these mystery token to get general strategies (such as how to react to monotone boards, Ace high boards etc).
